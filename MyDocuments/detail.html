General Information
<h1>What is Python?</h1>
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.<br>
It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic <br>
data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond<br>
object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming.<br>
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces<br>
to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, <br>
and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for <br>
applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs<br>
on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.<br>

<h1>What is the Python Software Foundation?</h1>
The Python Software Foundation is an independent non-profit organization <br>
that holds the copyright on Python versions 2.1 and newer. The PSF’s mission <br>
is to advance open source technology related to the Python programming language <br>
and to publicize the use of Python. The PSF’s home page is at https://www.python.org/psf/.<br>

<p>
Donations to the PSF are tax-exempt in the US. If you use Python and find<br>
  it helpful, please contribute via the PSF donation page.

<h1>Are there copyright restrictions on the use of Python?</h1>
<p>
You can do anything you want with the source, as long as you leave the copyrights in <br>
  and display those copyrights in any documentation about Python that you produce.<br>
  . If you honor the copyright rules, it’s OK to use Python for commercial use, to sell <br>
  copies of Python in source or binary form (modified or unmodified), or to sell products <br>
  that incorporate Python in some form. We would still like to know about all commercial<br>
  use of Python, of course.<br>

<h1>Why was Python created in the first place?</h1>
<p>
Here’s a very brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido van Rossum:<br>

I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the ABC group <br>
  at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about language design.<br>
  This is the origin of many Python features, including the use of indentation for statement <br>
  grouping and the inclusion of very-high-level data types (although the details are all different in Python).<br>


I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its features.<br>
  It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its implementation) to remedy my <br>
  complaints – in fact its lack of extensibility was one of its biggest problems.<br>
  I had some experience with using Modula-2+ and talked with the designers of Modula-3 <br>
  and read the Modula-3 report. Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used <br>
  for exceptions, and some other Python features.<br>

I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.<br>
  We needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either<br>
  C programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call <br>
  interface which wasn’t easily accessible from the Bourne shell. My experience<br>
  with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the importance of exceptions <br>
  as a programming language feature.<br>
